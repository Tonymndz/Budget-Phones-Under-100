        each one and another using <a href="https://www.phonemore.com/">phonemore.com</a> and
        <a href="https://www.versus.com"> versus.com</a>. From all the phones, I compared I
        managed to collect 5 of the phones that were in the top of their the
        game. They beat the rest of the phones I compared in terms of specs and
        claimed their spot on this list of the best budget phones under $100.

        personal feel, touch, or style. Now, let me show you the best budget
        phones under $100 I could find.
